# CS-250-Software-Development-Life-Cycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  Good team members use effective communication and take responsibility for the success of the project as a whole regardless of one's
individual role. The most important aspect of developing software is determining what precisely the software will do. This includes
dropping vague terms and adverbs like "precisely" in order to conduct more precise communications. User stories are an excellent tool 
to enable this style of communication by outlining the "what", "why", "who" and maybe even "where" and "when" of product specifications.
Then it's up to the developer to create "how" the software accomplishes what it must.

  Agile is all about developing better software through dynamic teamwork and effective communication between one another as team members, 
throughout development teams, across the whole company, and between the company and its product stakeholders.
